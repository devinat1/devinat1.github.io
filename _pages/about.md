Hello and welcome to my humble website! I am an AI engineer and researcher interested in building observability and evaluation of LLM based agentic systems. I currently work at Hue, where I wrote the Gemini integration with the Hue lighting ecosystem. Previously, I worked at MultiOn, where I built evals to better web/browser using agents.
