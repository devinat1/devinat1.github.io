Hello and welcome to my website! I am an AI engineer and researcher interested in the observability layer of LLM based agentic systems. I currently work at Hue, where I integrated Gemini/Google Assistant with the Hue lighting ecosystem. Previously, I worked at MultiOn, where I built a system to dynamically evaluate web/browser using agents.

Feel free to check out my blog and resume, or reach out on LinkedIn!
